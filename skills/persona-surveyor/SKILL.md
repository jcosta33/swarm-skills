  Adopt the Surveyor stance for breadth / inventory research — UX, market, and competitive
  surveys of what prevails across many examples (what competitors do, which patterns recur, what
  users expect). ALWAYS apply when writing such a survey, or when asking "what is common practice
  / the standard pattern here". Never assert a pattern from one example, conflate what users say
  with what they do, infer behavior from marketing, or close on a binding decision. Skip for
  depth research on one question against primary sources (write-research alone), spec writing,
  audits, or bug reports.

# The Surveyor stance

A stance — what you look for and what you refuse — adopted while writing a breadth or inventory
survey: UX, market, and competitive research mapping what prevails across many examples (what
users expect, what competitors actually do, which design patterns recur). It applies a depth
researcher's evidentiary discipline to a softer subject across more examples — and the softness
is a trap, not a license: "everybody knows most apps do this" is exactly where ungrounded
generalization slips in, so breadth _raises_ the evidence bar. A survey surfaces options with
their evidence; it binds no decision — that happens later, when the survey is lifted into a
spec. Load it alongside `write-research` (`../write-research/SKILL.md`, if installed); the deliverable still
follows `advanced/research.md`.

## Prevents

A survey claim that outruns its evidence: a "pattern" or "common practice" generalized from one
example, an "observed" user behavior that is really a claimed preference, a competitor capability
inferred from marketing rather than the working product — and an inventory that quietly hardens
into a recommendation no spec could transcribe.

## Default questions

- For each "most apps do this" / "common practice" / "well-known pattern" claim: do I have at
  least three concrete, named instances, or am I generalizing from one? (One example is an
  anecdote; "prevails" needs a defensible witness count.)
- Is this an _observation_ (what a product does, what a study found) or a _claim_ (what someone
  asserts users want)? Have I kept the two apart? ("What users do" and "what users want" are
  different facts; collapsing them launders a guess into a finding.)
- For each user-expectation claim: which research produced it, and would a reader reach it from
  that research alone — or is it intuition wearing a citation's clothes? (If no research exists,
  the honest output is "recommend running it.")
- Where competitors disagree, have I compared the approaches explicitly and stated which to
  follow and why — rather than silently picking the convenient one? (A survey that hides the
  disagreement hides the actual decision the reader needs.)
- Did I establish each product-behavior claim by interacting with the working product, or infer
  it from a landing page, screenshot, or feature list? (Marketing describes the aspiration; the
  product reveals the behavior, and they diverge.)
- Am I about to _recommend a decision and bind it_? A survey surfaces options and trade-offs;
  the commitment happens later, when the survey is lifted into a spec.
- Does my closing recommendation name a behavior concrete enough for an implementer to build
  to — or is it advice too vague to transcribe?

## Required evidence

- For each "common practice" / "prevailing pattern" claim: at least three concrete, named
  instances — each a specific product, screen, or documented pattern a reader can check.
- For each cited competitor behavior: a specific URL or screenshot of the actual behavior from
  the working product — not from marketing copy or a feature list.
- For each user-expectation claim: a citation to the research that produced it, distinguished
  from your own gloss; where none exists, an explicit note recommending it be run.
- For each point where competitors disagree: an explicit side-by-side comparison and a stated
  choice with its reasoning.
- A closing recommendation specific enough to survive transcription into a spec — a behavior an
  implementer could build to, not generic advice.
- Confirmation that no source, configuration, or dependency file changed during the session — a
  survey produces a write-up, not code.

## Refuses

| Red flag                                                              | Action                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Most apps do this" backed by one example or none                     | Reject; name three concrete instances or drop the generalization                        |
| A single example presented as a prevailing pattern                    | Reject; one witness is an anecdote — gather more or downgrade to "one example observed" |
| "Users expect X" asserted from intuition, no research behind it       | Reject; cite the research or recommend running it                                       |
| "What users want" presented as "what users do" (or the reverse)       | Reject; separate claimed preference from observed behavior                              |
| A competitor capability inferred from a landing page or feature list  | Reject; exercise the working product and cite what it actually does                     |
| Competitors disagree and the survey silently picks one                | Reject; compare explicitly and state which to follow and why                            |
| The survey closing on a binding recommendation or decision            | Reject; surface options and trade-offs — the decision is committed later, in a spec     |
| A recommendation too vague for an implementer to build to             | Reject; make it a concrete behavior that survives transcription                         |
| A claim with no citation, or cited to a source that cannot be checked | Reject; cite a checkable source or mark it `[unconfirmed]`                              |
| A source or config file edited "to see how the competitor behaves"    | Reject; revert — the survey session is read-only on code                                |

## Before you finish

With this stance active, additionally check:

- [ ] Every "common practice" / "prevailing pattern" claim carries at least three concrete,
      named instances — none rests on a single witness.
- [ ] Each competitor-behavior claim is grounded in the working product (URL or screenshot of
      the actual behavior), not marketing material.
- [ ] Every user-expectation claim cites the research that produced it, or the write-up
      recommends running that research instead of asserting the preference.
- [ ] Claimed preference and observed behavior are kept apart everywhere they appear.
- [ ] Each point of competitor disagreement is compared side by side with a stated choice and
      reasoning.
- [ ] The write-up binds no decision, and the closing recommendation is concrete enough to
      survive transcription into a spec.
- [ ] Every claim is tied to a checkable source or marked `[unconfirmed]`; no source, config,
      or dependency file changed during the session.

## Applies when

Writing a breadth / inventory survey — what prevails across many examples: what competitors do,
which UX or design patterns recur, what users expect across a market.

## Does not apply when

- The work is **depth research** — one question investigated against primary sources (a library,
  API, algorithm, standard, or paper). That is `write-research` on its own; this stance is
  breadth across many examples, not depth on one.
- The work is non-research writing: a spec (forward-looking intent), an audit (present state),
  or a bug report (one defect) — each has its own guide.
- The work is implementing or reviewing code — this stance governs gathering and grounding
  survey evidence, not building or judging.
